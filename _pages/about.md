I am currently a postdoc in the Department of Ergonomics at the [Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors](https://www.ifado.de/ifadoen/?noredirect=en_US). I earned my Phd in Neuroscience from the [International Graduate School in Neuroscience (IGSN)](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/igsn/) at the [Ruhr University Bochum](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/de)

Research
======
My research focuses on selective (spatial) attention, working memory, and multisensory processing. Particularly, I am interested in understanding how attention allows us to select currently relevant information and how this shapes perception. I am also interested in how attention interacts with working memory. While my Phd work originally focused on the auditory domain, I have more recently become interested multisensory processing. How does attention allow us to perceive information from different sensory modalities as multimodal objects? Is selective processing in multimodal environments governed by unisensory or rather amodal attention mechanisms? Drawing on a variety of methods from cognitive neuroscience and experimental psychology, I apply ERP analysis, time-frequency analysis, multivariate pattern analysis and diffusion modeling. 

I believe science should be open and transparent, ultimately increasing the credibility, trustworthiness and impact of our research. I have only just begun to dip my toes into the wonderful world of open science and am eager to implement more and more open science practices into my workflow. I am also passionate about science communication, trying to make our research more accessible to the public.
