I am currently a DAAD PRIME fellow, spending a one-year placement in the [Multisensory Perception, Learning and Attention lab](https://www.multisensorybrain.com/)  at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior and Radboud University Nijmegen, Nijmegen. I'm also affiliated with the 
[Institute of Medical Psychology](https://imp-frankfurt.de/Welcome.html#imp) at Goethe University . 

Research
======
My research focuses on selective (spatial) attention, working memory, and multisensory processing. Particularly, I am interested in understanding how attention allows us to select currently relevant information and how this shapes perception. I am also interested in how attention interacts with working memory. I study these questions from a multisensory perspective: How does attention allow us to perceive information from different sensory modalities as multimodal objects? Is selective processing in multimodal environments governed by unisensory or rather amodal attention mechanisms? And how is multisensory information encoded and stored in working memory? Drawing on a variety of methods from cognitive neuroscience and experimental psychology, I apply ERP analysis, time-frequency analysis, multivariate pattern analysis and cognitive modeling to answer those questions. 

I believe science should be open and transparent, ultimately increasing the credibility, trustworthiness and impact of our research. Therefore, I strive to implement open science practices into my workflow. I am also passionate about science communication, trying to make our research more accessible to the public. 

If you have any questions or comments concerning my research, please don't hesitate to drop me a note on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/lauraklatt.bsky.social) or get in touch via email (laura-isabelle.klatt[at]donders.ru.nl).
